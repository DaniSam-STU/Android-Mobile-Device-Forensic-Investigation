Call Log Analysis
-
The call log reveals multiple entries flagged as harassment, suspected fraud, and unknown numbers from locations such as Ahmedabad, Delhi, and Bangalore. Frequent calls from numbers like +91 140 836 7993 and +91 79 7181 8975 indicate persistent targeting. These logs are critical for establishing contact patterns and potential social engineering attempts.

SMS & Messaging Analysis
-
An SMS dated December 4, 2025, reports an unauthorized debit of ₹100,000 from a Union Bank of India account, urging the user to call a provided number if not recognized. Another message promotes an Insta EMI card with a pre-approved loan offer, marked as sent from an unknown number. Such messages align with typical phishing and financial fraud tactics.

Browser History Examination
-
The browser history contains multiple visits to suspicious domains such as go.realsh.xyz, squitoiages.com, and tentedienat.com. These domains may be associated with phishing or malware distribution. Additionally, searches related to SRM University, online payments, and document editing suggest both educational and transactional use of the device.

Application & Permission Review
-
The device hosts numerous applications including banking, social media, and utility apps. Permission logs show that 17 of 31 apps have location access, 14 of 32 have microphone access, and 11 of 13 have SMS access. Such broad permissions increase the risk of data leakage, especially if malicious apps are installed.

System Configuration & Security
-
The device runs Funtouch OS 15 on a Vivo V2356 model, with the latest security update dated November 1, 2025. The network is configured to prefer 5G via Jio, and Wi-Fi calling is enabled. The presence of encryption and updated software indicates a baseline level of security, though app-level vulnerabilities remain a concern.

Downloaded Files Inspection
-
Downloaded files include PDFs related to online fee payments, payment restrictions, and verification documents. A small configuration file (.exmu-cfg1.data) is also present, which may relate to app data or temporary caching. These files could contain sensitive personal or financial information.
