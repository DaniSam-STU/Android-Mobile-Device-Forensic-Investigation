# Android Mobile Device Forensic Investigation for Cyber Crime Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on the **forensic investigation of an Android mobile device** to identify, collect, analyze, and report digital evidence related to cyber crime activities. The study is conducted in a **simulated academic environment** and aligns with **IFSO (International Forensic Sciences Organisation)** learning objectives.

Android smartphones store critical digital artifacts such as call logs, SMS messages, browser history, and application data, which are often crucial in cyber crime investigations including fraud, phishing, and social engineering attacks.

## 🎯 Objectives
- To understand Android mobile forensic investigation procedures  
- To identify potential digital evidence stored on Android devices  
- To analyze mobile artifacts related to cyber crime incidents  
- To study forensic tools and investigation methodologies  
- To understand legal and procedural aspects of digital evidence  

---

## 🕵️ Case Scenario
A **simulated cyber crime case** is considered in which a user device receives suspicious calls, phishing-style messages, and visits potentially malicious websites. The Android device is examined to identify forensic artifacts that may indicate fraud or social engineering attempts.

> ⚠️ Note: This case study is **purely simulated** and used **only for academic and training purposes**.

## 🔍 Digital Evidence Analyzed
- Call logs (suspected fraud, harassment, unknown numbers)
- Blocked and filtered numbers
- SMS and messaging app alerts
- Browser history (suspicious and normal URLs)
- Device information and system settings
- Installed applications
- Network and SIM information

## 🧪 Forensic Investigation Methodology
The investigation follows standard digital forensic procedures:

1. **Identification** – Locating potential sources of evidence  
2. **Preservation** – Ensuring data integrity and preventing alteration  
3. **Collection** – Acquiring logical and accessible mobile data  
4. **Examination** – Filtering and extracting relevant artifacts  
5. **Analysis** – Correlating evidence and identifying suspicious patterns  
6. **Reporting** – Documenting findings in a forensic report
